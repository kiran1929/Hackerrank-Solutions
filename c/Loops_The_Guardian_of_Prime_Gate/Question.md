In the ancient kingdom of Zabiria, there exists a magical gate known as the Prime Gate.

The gate reacts differently depending on the nature of the number it receives:

It opens when given a Prime number
It remains closed when given a Composite number
It stays inactive when given a number that is neither Prime nor Composite
A young programmer Omkar has been chosen to guard the gate. Every day, the gate provides a natural number.
Omkar must determine the correct nature of the number so the gate behaves accordingly.

Your task is to help Omkar by writing a program that checks whether the given number is Prime, Composite, or Neither.

Input Format

A single line containing one natural number N.

Output Format

Print Prime, if the number is prime
Print Composite, if the number is composite
Print None, if the number is neither prime nor composite

Write a program that prints a sequence of values from 1 to N following the rules of the classic FizzBuzz problem.

Instead of printing all values on a single line, each value must be printed on a new line.

Rules

For numbers that are multiples of 3, print Fizz
For numbers that are multiples of 5, print Buzz
For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz
For all other numbers, print the number itself
Input Format

A single integer N

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁵
All inputs are valid
Output Format

Print the FizzBuzz sequence from 1 to N, each value on a separate line.

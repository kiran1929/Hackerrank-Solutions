You are given two integers h and m, representing time in 24-hour format:

h → Hour (0 to 23)
m → Minutes (0 to 59)
Your task is to convert this time into 12-hour format and print the result in the form:

{hh}:{mm} AM/PM - where hh and mm are converted hours and minutes double digit formats
Conversion Rules

00:00 to 11:59 → AM
12:00 to 23:59 → PM
In 12-hour format:

00 hours → 12 AM
12 hours → 12 PM
13–23 hours → 1-11 PM
Minutes must always be printed as given (including leading zeros when necessary).

Input Format

Two space-separated integers: {h} {m}

where

h is the hour
m is the minutes
Constraints

0 ≤ h ≤ 23
0 ≤ m ≤ 59
Output Format

Print the converted time in 12-hour format as:

{hh}:{mm} AM/PM , where hh and mm are converted hour and minute double digit formats

You are given an array of N integers. Compute the difference between the sum of elements stored at even indices and the sum of elements stored at odd indices.

Use 0-based indexing
Difference = (sum of even-index elements) − (sum of odd-index elements)
Input Format

First line: Integer N
Second line: N space-separated integers
Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁵
−10⁹ ≤ A[i] ≤ 10⁹
Output Format

Print a single integer representing the required difference.

On a number line starting from 1, two points begin moving forward.

The first point jumps forward by A units at a time.
The second point jumps forward by B units at a time.
Both points can only land on numbers that are multiples of their jump length.

The mathematician observing the number line wants to know:

At what smallest positive number will both points land together for the first time?
Task:

Given two natural numbers A and B, determine the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both numbers.

Input Format

A single line containing two space-separated natural numbers A and B.

Constraints

1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10^9

Output Format

Print a single integer — the first common landing point of both sequences i.e. LCM.

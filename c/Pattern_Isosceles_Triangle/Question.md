Write a program to print an isosceles triangle pattern based on the number of rows n provided by the user.

The pattern has the following properties:

The triangle consists of n rows.
Each row contains spaces followed by asterisks (*), forming a centered isosceles triangle.
Note: Handle invalid inputs gracefully by displaying an appropriate error message, "Shape Not Possible",
if the triangle cannot be drawn by the given input value.

Input Format

A single integer n.
Constraints

-50 ≤ n ≤ 50
Output Format

Print the isosceles triangle pattern consisting on n rows.
Print "Shape Not Possible" if the triangle cannot be drawn.

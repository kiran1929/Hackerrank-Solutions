Function Signature

void reverseArray(int arr[], int n);
Input Format

The function reverseArray will receive:
An integer array arr of size n.
An integer n representing the number of elements in the array.
Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵
-10⁶ ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10⁶
You must modify the given array in-place → No additional arrays should be used.
Output Format

The function should modify the given array in-place by reversing its elements.
You do not need to print anything.

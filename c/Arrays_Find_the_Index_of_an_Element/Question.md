You are given an array of integers and a target element. Your task is to find the first occurrence index of the target element in the array. If the element is not found, return -1.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer N, the size of the array.
The second line contains N space-separated integers, representing the array elements.
The third line contains a single integer, target, the element to search for.
Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
−10^6 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ target ≤ 10^5
Output Format

Print the 0-based index of the first occurrence of target in the array.
If target is not found, print -1.

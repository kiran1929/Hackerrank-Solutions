Write a C program to classify an integer N into one of the following categories based on specific conditions:

Categories:

Category A: N is divisible by 2 and 3 but not divisible by 5.
Category B: N is greater than 20 and is the product of two distinct prime numbers within the range of [2,11].
Valid numbers: 6, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 33, ...
Category C: N is divisible by either 3 or 7 but not both, and N is a two-digit number.
Category D: N is a perfect square less than 200.
Valid squares: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, ...
Category E: If none of the above conditions are satisfied.
Note: Output the category that comes first in lexicographic order.

Input Format

A single integer N

Constraints

-10^3 ≤ N ≤ 10^3

Output Format

A single character representing the category of N ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', or 'E').

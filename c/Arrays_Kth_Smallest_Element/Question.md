Given an array of integers that may contain duplicate elements and an integer K, your task is to find the Kth smallest element in the array without using a sorting algorithm. 
Instead of sorting the entire array, solve the problem using an efficient algorithm.

Function Signature

int kthSmallest(int arr[], int n, int k);
Note: Each unique number should be considered only once. For example, given the array [1, 1, 2], the 2nd smallest element is 2, not 1.

Input Format

Line 1: An integer n representing the number of elements in the array.
Line 2: n space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.
Line 3: An integer k, representing the order of the smallest element to find.
Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
-10^9 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ k ≤ n
Output Format

A single integer representing the Kth smallest element in the array.

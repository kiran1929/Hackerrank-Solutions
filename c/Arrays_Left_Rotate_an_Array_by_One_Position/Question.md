You are given an array of integers. Your task is to implement a function that modifies the given array in-place to left rotate it by one position.

Function Signature

void leftRotateByOne(int arr[], int n);
Note: The function should not return anything and must modify the given array itself.

Input Format

The function leftRotateByOne will receive:
An integer array arr of size n.
An integer n representing the number of elements in the array.
Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵
-10⁶ ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10⁶
You must modify the given array in-place → No additional arrays should be used.
Output Format

The function should modify the given array in-place by one left rotation.
You do not need to print anything.
